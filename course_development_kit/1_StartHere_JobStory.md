### Job Story
Write the [job story](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/UX/Job+Stories) that describes what a user is doing, or will need to do, that a training will address. Some training projects require multiple job stories. Break down the product into what need it fulfills for the user and what value the user will gain. This step is ideally done with an instructional designer.

#### Template:

|Prompt| You Write|
|------|----------|
|When I am| [doing what task or job? or in what situation?]|
|I want to| [accomplish what?]|
|so that |[motivation? for what reason?]|

#### Example
When Iâ€™m running on a large set of nodes and don't want to have too much output to sift through, I only want to know about failures, so that I can troubleshoot if need be.

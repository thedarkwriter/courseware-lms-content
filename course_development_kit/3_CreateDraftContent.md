To design a hands-on activity, start with the answer to the question from [step 1](https://github.com/puppetlabs/courseware-lms-content/blob/master/course_development_kit/1_StartHere_JobStory.md#example)
  
**What does a user need to be able to do with that product?** 
 
Your activity allows the user to practice the skills necessary to accomplish that goal. Ideally, it also gives them a reference when they work in their own system or infrastructure.

### Write clear instructions and share with the user
1. What the user will learn and what they will actually do to accomplish this
2. What technical tools they need to have before they start
3. How long the lab should take them
4. What is the completion or pass/fail criteria

### Build only what you and the user need
1. Keep the build as simple as possible. 
2. Avoid adding in tools or technology that the user may not know and does not need to use our product
3. Automate testing 

### Document everything
1. Prepare the activity so anyone could step in and validate or change it

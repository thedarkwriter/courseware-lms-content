Based on the job story, consider your audience's skills, needs, and experience. Skill levels can be somewhat arbitrary, but they provide a general framework for what to build. Start by defining the user's experience and knowledge--how long have they been doing their job? How familiar are they with the foundational concepts of the product? What must they know in order to succeed in the training? What do they need to be able to do after the training? What level of engagement do they need?

Here is a quick cheat sheet of skills mapped to training levels:

### Advanced Trainings
An advanced training assumes the user understands all foundational concepts and provides a hands-on, challenging approach to learning. Advanced trainings provide a high degree of interactivity and may not have clear-cut exercises with answers. 

| Skill Type | Outcomes/Application|
|--------------|---------------------|
|Creation  |  Builds or designs workflows or strategies|
|Evaluation | Makes informed choice in a complex techical scenario|

### Intermediate Trainings
Intermediate trainings combine hands-on practice with more guided instruction. Provide learners with resources for each step of the process and constrain the amount of freedom learners have to limit frustration and mistakes.

| Skill Type | Outcomes/Application|
|--------------|---------------------|
| Analysis| Distinguishes between options in technical use cases|
| Application| Solves problems and writes code|

### Beginner Trainings
Beginner trainings provide a highly guided experience with frequent checkpoints for learners to self-assess. They should include definitions, explanations of core concepts, and focus on one concept at a time.

| Skill Type | Outcomes/Application|
|--------------|---------------------|
|Understanding| Classifies or explains concepts|
|Memorization| Defines key terminology|

## How to build these trainings?
Below are some methods to use for each level of training. Text and images and videos are great ways to teach, but consider how we are getting the message across to them based on their skill level and the intended outcome.

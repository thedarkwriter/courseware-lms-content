## How to use this kit

Use this to create a plan and build training and enablement material. Ideally, you will work with an instructional designer throughout the process. But this kit should also get you a really good start if you are not familiar with instructional techniques.

## Ongoing work
This kit is incomplete and currently lacks:
* Instructional examples
* Detailed templates for all learning techniques listed
* Links to instructional resources

PRs and edits always welcome!

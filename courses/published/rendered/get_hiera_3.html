      <p>In the last lesson, we assigned the value of a variable using the <code>hiera()</code>
function and that variable was passed into a profile called <code>profile::dns</code>.
There is actually a better pattern for doing this, you can use the <code>hiera()</code>
function inside the class definition as the default parameter.</p>

      <p>So when you define your <code>profile::dns</code> class it would look something like this:</p>
      <pre>
class profile::dns (
  $dns_server = hiera('dns_server')
) {
...
}  
</pre>

      <p>Since you wouldn&#8217;t need to specify the <code>dns_server</code> parameter when you declare
the class, you can now include the <code>profile::dns</code> class with this code:</p>
      <pre>
include profile::dns
</pre>

      <p>But there&#8217;s a problem. As you write more code like this, it becomes very easy
to lose track of which key/value pair applies to what class. The standard
convention is to use the name of class as part of the Hiera key like this:
<code>profile::dns::dns_server</code>.</p>

      <p>This convention isn&#8217;t just to make things easy to remember. Since Puppet 3,
there has been a feature called &#8220;Automatic Parameter Lookup&#8221; which means you
can leave out the Hiera call from the class definition. When the Puppet master
compiles a catalog for your node it will check in Hiera before falling back to
the defaults.</p>

      <p>In our example, let&#8217;s assume there&#8217;s a default value in <code>profile::params</code>:</p>

      <pre>
class profile::dns (
  $dns_server = $profile::params::dns_server
) {
...
}
</pre>

      <p>Now if there is a value in Hiera for <code>profile::dns::dns_server</code> the master will
use that, otherwise it will fall back to what&#8217;s in <code>params.pp</code> of the &#8220;profile&#8221;
module. You may be thinking that Hiera understands namespaces, so it&#8217;s somehow
filing the <code>dns_server</code> key under <code>profile::dns</code>, but that isn&#8217;t correct. Hiera
just uses the entire string <code>profile::dns::dns_server</code> as a single key.</p>

      <p>As always, you can still override both defaults by specifying the
parameter yourself:</p>

      <pre>
class {'profile::dns':
  dns_server =&gt; 'globaldns.puppetlabs.vm',
}
</pre>

      <p>Automatic Parameter Lookup is one of the ways in which Hiera can seem &#8220;magical&#8221;
to new users.  To help you get the hang of how it works, we&#8217;ve created a few
example classes that take parameters. Play around with it until it makes sense.</p>

      <p>For this exercise, you&#8217;ll be running <code>puppet agent -t</code> against a Puppet master.
For convenience, we&#8217;ve made a link to your agent&#8217;s environment on the master to
the <code>/root/puppetcode</code> directory on the agent node.  You can just declare the
example classes in the <code>default</code> node definition in
<code>/root/puppetcode/manifests/site.pp</code> and run puppet on your agent node.</p>

      <p>Hiera lookups are done on the master, so you&#8217;ll need to change the files in 
<code>/root/puppetcode/hieradata</code> which is mapped to your environment.</p>

      <p>The master doesn&#8217;t use the <code>hiera.yaml</code> on your agent, but the default configuration
is to include the <code>hieradata</code> directory in your environment.</p>

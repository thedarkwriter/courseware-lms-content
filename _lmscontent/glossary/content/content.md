### Glossary

**Declarative Language:** A style of coding that describes the end result, without the steps of how to do it. [You can learn more about declarative languages and why they are so great here](https://www.netguru.co/blog/imperative-vs-declarative).

**Resource:** Something on a server that you would like to manage. [Learn more about resources here](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_resources.html).

**Attribute:** A manageable configuration for a resource. For example, the owner of a file. [Here's a more in depth explanation of attributes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing))

**Node**: A single machine that uses Puppet. For example, your laptop could be a node. An individual server could also be a node. [Here's some more info about Puppet Nodes.](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.0/lang_node_definitions.html)

**Syntax Validation:** Checking that your code is in the right format without checking what it's actually doing. [You can learn about Puppet Syntax here](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/style_guide.html).

**Facts:** Information about a specific node written in the form of a series of key-value pairs. This information might include the operating system being used, the IP address, or whether or not it is a virtual machine. [Learn more about facts here](https://puppet.com/blog/fact).

**Array**: An array is a series of values denoted by square brackets that looks like `['one', 'two', 'three']`. [Learn more about arrays here.](https://techterms.com/definition/array)

**Hash:** A hash is a series of key-value pairs denoted by curly braces that looks like `{ 'a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', 'c' => 'C' }`. [Learn more about hashes here.](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25432/hash-code)

**Directory:** In computing, a directory is a catalog containing related files, also sometimes called a folder. A directory can contain other directories (known as subdirectories). These are typically referred to as having a parent-child relationship, with the top-most directory being referred to as the 'root'. [Learn more about directories here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing))

**Symlink:** Also known as a symbolic link, or a soft link. A symlink points to the entry that contains the data; it does not contain the data itself. [Learn more about symlinks here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)

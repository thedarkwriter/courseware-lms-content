Puppet Public Pages
=======================

This dir is for public facing pages on learn.puppet.com.  

The parent pages can be found [here](https://internal-puppetlabs.trainingrocket.com/admin/page/search.html).

Some pages contain blurbs, which can be found [here](https://internal-puppetlabs.trainingrocket.com/admin/blurb/search.html).  Blurbs are HTML/Freemarker snippets that can be reused across multiple pages.

The static files dir has been setup to mirror the structure of the [static file directories](https://internal-puppetlabs.trainingrocket.com/admin/static) in LearnDot.  These files *cannot* be managed via the API, only manually.
